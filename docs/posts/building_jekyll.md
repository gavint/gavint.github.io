# The Journey Begins!

I've started creating this site to increase my knowledge of Jekyll.

I have a number of photos I plan on displaying, it's a hobby. I also want to experiment with different Javascript elements, which I'm not so familiar with at present.

If you got here and know me - awesome.  

As soon as the site is more of something that I want to make public, I'll add my name and contact details to it.

Enjoy!
