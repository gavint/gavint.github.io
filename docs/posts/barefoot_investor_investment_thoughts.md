# I keep writing this in the Barefoot investor pages on FB - here's my thought.

Let's look at it this way:  if you were to invest $50k in to an ETF, you will probably make 15% gains in a good year and 5-10% in a bad year.  That's a $2.5k - $7.5k gain per annum.  There's a small potential that you will loose capital, but historically, you will win 9 out of 10 years investing in an ETF.   If you reinvest the dividends you compound your interest and keep making more each year.  You don't need extensive knowledge of which company will win - you have invested in all of them.  If a new facebook comes along and you are invested in an ETF, some of your money will automagically go to that new company and any growth they get, you will also get a small portion of.  Sure - you don't get the rocket ride of just investing in one company, but you also don't get the risk of losing it all when it fails - and many do fail.

Physical gold - it's nice to hold in your hand and if the stock market falls, gold goes up usually.  I don't think it's the best investment though.  It's more something that gains in the 5-10 year range.  But it's nice to hold in your hand ðŸ™‚

Property is a place where you can really make your money do some heavy lifting.  But it's also risky - there's many who do well, and many who don't.  Here essentially you'd use your 50k to borrow 500k, and then you can make returns of 3-5% on the 500k. or ~$15-$25k per year.  It requires a lot more research to get it right.  And one bad tennant can ruin 2 years of work. One poor decision can cost you any benefit at all from investing in property.  And that's why I assume Scott won't recommend it.  It's not a one size fits all solution.  

You can leverage (borrow) to invest in shares if you want.  That could be the best of both worlds between shares and property.  But it's riskier, there's margin calls, more potential gain, and more potential loss.  Know what you're doing first. 

Bitcoin/Crypto - I won't touch that one.  To my eye it's gambling.  There's no real physical commodity you own and it's too easily manipulated.  I also haven't studied it in depth.
